# Release

1. Set the new `version` in `orca-plugin.json` (semver: patch for color fixes, minor for new languages or tokens).
2. Add a "What's new in X.Y.Z" section to `README.md`.
3. If the screen looks different, regenerate `images/cover.png` (PNG, at least 800×500, at most 1 MB).
4. Run the checks in `CLAUDE.md`.
5. Commit on `release/vX.Y.Z`.
6. Hand the user these commands; the agent's sandbox blocks pushes and repository changes:

```
! git switch main && git merge --ff-only release/vX.Y.Z
! git push origin main
! git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z
! git branch -d release/vX.Y.Z
```

The community catalog picks up the tag in about 30 minutes. Each version is permanent there: a fix is always a new version, never a moved tag.

Keep `engines.orca` at the lowest version whose fields the manifest uses (now `>=1.4.246`, because `publisher` is omitted). Keep `license` as `GPL-3.0`, the license of Bearded Theme.
